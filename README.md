# busfs-server

Basically Useless Simple File Storage is a very minimalist server side code with a web ui that lets you upload files, view uploaded files, and (will let you) download and delete those files. It is protected by basic HTTP authentication with an easy to set config. It is written in Python using Flask. For more information about its capabilities and limitations, please visit the wiki.

Warning: Do not use this app yet. It is not completed, but I hope soon it will be production ready.
